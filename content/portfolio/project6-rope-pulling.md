For this project, the idea was to simulate a rope pulling game in VR. I ran a study where participants would pull a rope in the real world, which overlapped with a virtual rope in VR. The idea was to have participants pull ropes with various looking avatars and see if the participants would change their rope pulling strength according to the avatars' appearances.



For this project I used Unity 3D, LeapMotion (Ultraleap) controller with a Vive headset, Hi5 VR Gloves from Noitom and the UMA library.

The project is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/aam505/UnityTugOfWar) with my [thesis](https://github.com/aam505/MasterThesis).
