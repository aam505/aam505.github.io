While not strictly a VR project, I ran a study in which novice users would interact with a commercial chatbot called [Replika](https://replika.com/). Now, this chatbot is also available in VR. 

I was interested in the user experience of interacting with a chatbot. Later, I also interviewed several long-term users of Replika and presented some interesting findings with respect to both these groups.
