These applications explore the idea of a shape-changing body in virtual reality. What if, instead of using tools, the body itself changes based on user needs?

For this project I toyed with particle physics in Unity and leared about shape-keys and morph targets in Blender. While this project never turned into a research paper, it was a fun task. Thinking about the avatar as a morphing and shape-shifting entity opens up many interaction possibilites.
