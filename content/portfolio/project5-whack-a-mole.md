This app is part of a project I developed as an assistant researcher before starting my PhD. I implemented this VR whack-a-mole application.

For this project I leared Blender and made the Mole 3D model (and the game box) because I couldn't find a cute mole and all of the moles were creepy. I also did the animation myself. This helped me change the model and the animation according to the researcher I developed this app for. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perceived performance within a whack-a-mole game.
